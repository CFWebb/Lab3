-adding in a input from user to change rules
adding in buttons for rules
customizing layout, clicking a cell to make it alive or dead

My simulation currently supports
	-Pausing
		-Pausing allows the user to take a break so they don't lose anything
	-manipulating the number of neighbors needed to live or survive(randomly)
		-this allows the user to observe different rules other than Conway's rule to more accurately simulate real life
	-manipulating the initial state(randomly)
		-this allows the user to change the state to observe how an increase or decrease in initial cells affect the simulation
	-increasing and decreasing the frame rate speed of the simulation
		-this allows the user to slow down the simulation to understand the interactions better, or to speed them up if they just want to observe is all the cells live or die in each simulation run
	-restart with changed parameters
		-this allows the user to do an experiment based on their rules without having to reset them
	-restart with default parameters
		-this allows the user to restart the simulation from the default parameters without having to remember what the parameters are to set them back to normal

Interaction opportunities identified from analysis
	1. Adding in input from user to change rules 
		-the user should be able to enter in their own customized numbers for the rules 
		-I identified this problem through the use of playtesting by Tom Clark
		-Reconfigure
	2. Adding in buttons for rules
		-the user should be able to choose the rules and see them on the screen as opposed to printing them out to the user, which can quickly get put out of sight by the statuses printed out to the user
		-I identified this problem through the use of playtesting by Tom Clark
		-Elaborate
	3. Clicking on the simulation to create or destroy cells
		-The user should be able to click on the simulation to create or destroy the cells on the screen to better suit their own purposes
		-I identified this problem through the use of playtesting by Tom Clark
		-Select
